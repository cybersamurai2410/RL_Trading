# Enhancing Time Series Trading Strategies with Deep Reinforcement Learning Methodologies (MSc Advanced Computing - Individual Project)

**Aims & Objectives:**<br>
The aim of this project is to leverage advanced computational techniques with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) including recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures and ensemble modelling by aggregating the actions of different models and evaluating performance metrics, in order to enhance trading strategies and profitability in financial markets.

**Design:**<br>
![Model Architecture](https://github.com/cybersamurai2410/RL_Trading/blob/9159435305180ea99e9a91c4ba2fc243e01966de/model_architecture.png)

**Methodology and Implementation**<br>
1. Time Series Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Trading Environment Setup
3. Deep RL Models Selection
4. Hyperparameter Optimization and Model Training
5. Ensemble Model Development
6. Architecture Modification with RNN
7. Custom Environment and Feature Engineering Technical Indicators
8. Model Performance Evaluation

**Conclusion**<br>
* Utilising RNN architecture with DRL is capable of making more profitable trades compared to a standard MLP architecture.
* Ensemble modelling by aggregating actions via voting/averaging combines decisions of various models for more robustness but does not lead to better performance.
* Continuous trading environment offers more flexibility in simulating real-world trading scenarios compared to discrete trading environments as well as generalising multiple stocks.
  * Utilising technical indicators for trading allow the algorithms to improve pattern recognition on the stock data.
